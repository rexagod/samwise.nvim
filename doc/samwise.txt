INTRODUCTION				*samwise-introduction*

|samwise| is a line-wise note-taking plugin for neovim that aims to provide a
better note-taking enviroment by employing vim's concepts. It allows you to
take notes in a different buffer (each samwise buffer is unique to its parent
buffer) which is created automatically based on the current buffer's path and
the current buffer's name.

If the current line in the buffer does not have a corresponding <EOL>
character as the only content in the samwise buffer, the user is dropped to
the corresponding line, and the samwise buffer scrolls sychronously with its
parent buffer and vice versa. Users can make changes, or add new text entries
for any line of the parent buffer in this manner and even commit those besides
the parent buffer, as a "comment file" so as to not populate the parent buffer
with extraneous comments and keep the codebase cleaner in general. This is just
one of the many use cases where |samwise| can help.

It also allows highlighting hunks which correspond to the samwise buffer
entries, navigating between them, and seeing those entries either in a floating
window, or by echoing them.
